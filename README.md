# how-code-can-earn-passive-income


##### As a developer, there are several ways you can earn passive income. Here are some ideas:

##### Create and sell digital products: 

You can create digital products like software, mobile apps, website themes, or plugins, and sell them on marketplaces like Envato or your own website. You can also create software as a service (SaaS) products and sell subscriptions.

##### Develop and sell online courses: 
 
 If you have expertise in a particular programming language or technology, you can create online courses and sell them on platforms like Udemy, Coursera, or Teachable.

##### Build and sell apps: 

You can build mobile or web apps and sell them on app stores like Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Alternatively, you can develop and sell apps through your own website or marketplace platforms like Gumroad.

##### Create and monetize a blog or YouTube channel: 

You can create a blog or YouTube channel where you share your coding knowledge and experiences. You can monetize your content through ads, sponsorships, or affiliate marketing.

##### Sell your services on freelance platforms: 

You can offer your coding skills on freelance platforms like Upwork, Freelancer, or Fiverr. You can also create your own website or portfolio to attract clients directly.

##### Invest in stocks or cryptocurrencies: 

You can invest in stocks or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This may not be directly related to your coding skills, but it can be a good source of passive income if you invest wisely.

Remember, building a passive income stream takes time and effort. You may not see immediate results, but with persistence and consistency, you can create a sustainable source of income that can support you for years to come.
